And also i have this code that finds forex pairs that exist in each of this files ( the .txt files)


The code:
import re

def read_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
    return content

def find_forex_pairs(file_paths):
    file_contents = [read_file(file_path) for file_path in file_paths]

    # Initialize forex_pairs with pairs from the first file
    forex_pairs = set(re.findall(r'[A-Z]{6}', file_contents[0]))

    # Iterate over the remaining files and find the intersection of forex_pairs with each file's pairs
    for content in file_contents[1:]:
        pairs = set(re.findall(r'[A-Z]{6}', content))
        forex_pairs = forex_pairs.intersection(pairs)

    return forex_pairs


# List of file paths
file_paths = ['BB_signals.txt', 'MA_signals.txt', 'MACD_signals.txt', 'RSI_signals.txt']

# Finding forex pairs
forex_pairs = find_forex_pairs(file_paths)

# Printing the forex pairs
print("Forex market pairs:")
for pair in forex_pairs:
    print(pair)



The output of the code:
PS C:\Users\val\Desktop\Trading\trash> python final.py                      
Forex market pairs:
EURGBP
USDMXN
AUDNZD
GBPNZD
GBPCAD
EURNZD
GBPAUD
USDTRY
USDCHF
USDZAR
GBPCHF

What i want from you is to help me write the best code that cad do this (i just don't know what or how to explain this to you)

Note this is just an example:

Pair | Signals | from 
GBPCAD | Hold \n Sell\n Hold\n Hold | BB \n MA \n MACD \n RSI
EURGBP | Sell \n Sell\n Sell\n Buy | BB \n MA \n MACD \n RSI
USDZAR | Hold \n Sell\n Buy\n Hold | BB \n MA \n MACD \n RSI




so from the info above, if pair has more than a half of maybe hold or sell or buy then the sell or buy or hold wins. 
please feel free to ask me question if you do not understand somewhere to make thing easy and accurate.

please first condition is that the pair must appear in each .txt file then the signal must appear more than twice from the .txt files
